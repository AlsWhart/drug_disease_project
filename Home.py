Welcome to the **Drug-Disease Interaction App**!
This project serves as a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate the feasibility of using AI and genomic data for drug repurposing. By integrating multi-source biomedical datasets, we aim to explore whether machine learning models can successfully predict new drug-disease relationships based on genomic biomarkers and drug interactions.
